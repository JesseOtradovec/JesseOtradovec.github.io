subtitle: Why I'm Awesome

My name is Jesse Otradovec. I have the following qualities:

#### Love of Physics
- I get really excited about science. 
- Angular momentum still feels a bit like magic to me. I hope that wonder at physics never wears off.
- I have a BS in Physics and Astronomy-Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.- 
- I've done research on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and on comparing various phenominological models used in the pipline in hunting for gravitational waves from LIGO. 
- My next project is on a particle physics data set. I'm excessively excited about it. I miss physics. 
- I'd really like to get back into physics research after Lambda School with all my shiny new Data Science knowledge. 

#### Love of Data, and Data Visualizations
- I'm currently enjoying being a student at Lambda School, which is a great learning environment. I'm on the Full-Time Data Science track, slotted to be done in May. Keep checking in here as I build my portfolio!
- I enjoy presenting data in visually pleasing and accessible ways.
- I'm currently interested in machine learning models being used to streamline particle detection at colliders like the LHC. 
- I'm the sort who can spend a whole afternoon getting a plot to look just so in matplotlib. I love beautiful plots. And have so many feelings about plots that are hard to read.

#### Pack and Fun

- I like D&D and other tabletop RPGs. I'm playing a Pathfinder game with Lambda students. I also have a meatspace D&D campaign going on.
- I do daycare for a few dogs because my dog is really social and is happier when he has friends who come and visit him. 
- I have nine rats who are my world. I'm a rat person. I love rats so much. They are so smart and affectionate.

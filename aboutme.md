My name is Jesse Otradovec. I have the following qualities:

- I get really excited about science.
- I am currently editing this silly little webpage to learn about making a portfolio site at Lambda School. 
- Lambda School is fun. Data Science is fun. Physics is fun. Wouldn't life be really fun if I had a job where I made physics plots beautiful? And did data analysis? Especially about physics? Yea... I have interests... 
- I like D&D too and am working on organizing Lambda students into a campaign. 
- I'm extremely loyal to my pack.

What else do you need?

### my history

Wouldn't this be a great place to put a CV? #TODO <- that (but maybe after this website is a reasonable thing... instead of a learning tool, which is all it is right now)
